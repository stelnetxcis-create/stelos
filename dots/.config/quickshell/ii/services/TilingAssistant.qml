/**
 * Tracks window move and resize gestures so the tiling overlay knows when to
 * appear, and resolves the cursor into a tiling zone on the monitor it is over.
 *
 * The gesture itself is detected by scripts/hyprland/drag_monitor.py, which
 * watches Hyprland far more tightly than a QML timer could. It knows about a
 * drag only through the companion keybinds below, which report Hyprland's own
 * drag binds - so a client-side titlebar drag, which fires no bind, is not a
 * gesture this reacts to at all. See the script's header for why.
 *
 * On drop the window is floated and given the zone's exact geometry, and the
 * geometry it had before is kept so dragging it back out can undo that. The
 * same thing happens without the mouse through the quick-tile shortcuts below.
 *
 * Resizing a tiled window past its zone drags the divider it shares with its
 * neighbours instead of overlapping them, and they follow.
