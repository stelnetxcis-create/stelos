    // stdout — an event monitor with nothing to report — then lives forever. Long
    // lived children are given the kernel's parent-death signal instead, which
    // fires no matter how the shell went down.

    // setpriv is util-linux and effectively always present, but the fallback keeps
    // the child working rather than failing to spawn if it ever isn't. bash execs
    // itself away either way, so the child's parent stays Quickshell, which is
    // what the parent-death signal keys on.
