//! Battery level, charge state and pack energy, read from sysfs.
//!
//! Separate from `energy.rs`, which only ever wants a draw figure to divide
//! between apps: this reads the pack itself, so a discharge curve can be drawn
//! for the device rather than attributed to anything.
//!
//! Level comes from `charge_now / charge_full` (or the energy pair on packs that
//! report watt-hours), not from `capacity` — the kernel rounds that to whole
//! percent, and a whole percent is an hour of a flat curve.
//!
//! Watt-hours in and out are integrated from the instantaneous draw rather than
//! differenced from the level: `charge_now` is refreshed by the firmware every few
//! minutes at best, so a whole hour of moderate use can pass with the reported
//! charge never moving, and then step by a percent all at once.
//!
//! The pack's full capacity is charge times the *nominal* voltage, not the
//! instantaneous one — `voltage_now` sags under load and springs back when the
//! machine goes quiet.
