# osk_autoshow

Raises the on-screen keyboard when a text field is focused by finger or pen.

## Why a helper is needed

Wayland tells an *input method* when a client focuses a text field, via
`zwp_input_method_v2`. Quickshell exposes no QML binding for that protocol and
Hyprland's IPC has no equivalent event, so the shell has no way to know a text
field was focused.

The helper binds `zwp_input_method_v2` purely as an observer — it never grabs the
keyboard and never commits text, so key events reach applications unchanged. Typing
is still done by the shell through ydotool.

It also watches `/dev/input` directly, because the protocol reports *that* a text
field was focused but not which device did it. `OskAutoShow.qml` correlates the two
so that mouse clicks and Tab navigation never raise the keyboard.

## Building

```bash
cd ~/.config/quickshell/ii/scripts/osk/osk_autoshow_src
cargo build --release
cp target/release/osk_autoshow ../
```

## Output protocol

One event per line on stdout:

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `activate` | a text field gained focus |
| `deactivate` | the focused text field went away |
| `touch <x> <y>` | finger contact, coordinates normalized to 0..1 |
| `pen <x> <y>` | pen contact, coordinates normalized to 0..1 |
| `key` | a press on a physical keyboard (throttled to 5 Hz) |
| `unavailable` | another input method holds the seat; the helper exits |

## Requirements

- Membership of the `input` group, to read `/dev/input/event*`. Devices whose names
  look virtual (`ydotool`, `uinput`) are skipped so the keyboard cannot close itself
  by typing.
- No other input method bound to the seat. fcitx5, ibus and this helper are mutually
  exclusive — only one client may hold `zwp_input_method_v2`.
- Applications must implement `text-input-v3`. Most GTK and Qt apps do; some Electron
  builds do not, and the keyboard simply won't auto-show there.

## Configuration

Everything lives under `osk.autoShow` in `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json`,
and is exposed in Settings → Overlays → On-screen Keyboard. `enable` is `false` by
default; while it is off the helper is never launched.
